# Security Documentation

## Introduction

Ensuring the security of the **Automated Multi-Broker Trading System** is paramount. This document outlines the security measures implemented to protect user data, secure system operations, and comply with relevant regulations.

## Security Principles

- **Confidentiality:** Protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
- **Integrity:** Ensure data is accurate and unaltered.
- **Availability:** Ensure system resources are accessible when needed.
- **Accountability:** Maintain audit trails for all actions within the system.

## Authentication and Authorization

### 1. User Authentication

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):**
  - Used for authenticating users.
  - Tokens are issued upon successful login and are required for accessing protected API endpoints.
  - Tokens have an expiration time to enhance security.

- **OAuth2 Protocol:**
  - Implemented to manage authorization flows securely.
  - Ensures users grant appropriate access without exposing credentials.

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **Roles Defined:**
  - **User:** Standard user with access to personal trading strategies and data.
  - **Admin:** Elevated privileges to manage system configurations and oversee user activities.

- **Permissions:**
  - Defined based on roles to restrict access to sensitive operations and data.

## Data Protection

### 1. Data Encryption

- **In Transit:**
  - All data transmitted between clients and servers is encrypted using HTTPS (SSL/TLS).
  - Ensures data confidentiality and integrity during transmission.

- **At Rest:**
  - Sensitive data stored in PostgreSQL is encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
  - Protects data from unauthorized access in case of a data breach.

### 2. Secure Storage of Secrets

- **Environment Variables:**
  - API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information are stored in environment variables.
  - `.env` files are excluded from version control using `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure.

- **AWS Secrets Manager:**
  - (Optional) Utilize AWS Secrets Manager for enhanced secret management and rotation.

## API Security

### 1. Input Validation

- **Sanitization:**
  - All incoming data is sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting).
  
- **Validation:**
  - Use Pydantic models in FastAPI to enforce data types and constraints.
  - Reject malformed or unexpected data with appropriate error responses.

### 2. Rate Limiting

- **Purpose:**
  - Prevent abuse and protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
  
- **Implementation:**
  - Utilize middleware to limit the number of requests per IP address within a specified timeframe.
  - Configure different rate limits for various API endpoints based on their sensitivity and usage patterns.

### 3. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

- **Configuration:**
  - Define allowed origins, methods, and headers to control which domains can interact with the API.
  
- **Best Practices:**
  - Restrict CORS policies to trusted domains.
  - Avoid using wildcard origins (`*`) in production environments.

## Logging and Monitoring

### 1. Activity Logging

- **Purpose:**
  - Maintain records of all significant actions within the system for auditing and troubleshooting.
  
- **Implementation:**
  - Log user authentications, trade executions, API requests, and system errors.
  - Store logs securely and ensure they are tamper-proof.

### 2. Monitoring

- **Tools:**
  - **AWS CloudWatch:** Monitor system performance metrics and set up alarms for critical events.
  - **Prometheus & Grafana:** Collect and visualize real-time metrics for in-depth analysis.

- **Alerts:**
  - Configure alerts for unusual activities, such as multiple failed login attempts or unexpected spikes in trade executions.
  - Ensure timely notifications to administrators for prompt response.

## Secure Development Practices

### 1. Regular Updates

- **Dependencies:**
  - Keep all software dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
  
- **Operating Systems:**
  - Regularly update server operating systems with security patches.

### 2. Code Reviews

- **Process:**
  - Implement mandatory code reviews for all Pull Requests.
  - Ensure adherence to coding standards and security best practices.
  
- **Tools:**
  - Utilize GitHubâ€™s code review features to facilitate collaborative reviews.

### 3. Vulnerability Assessments

- **Tools:**
  - Use static code analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube) to detect security vulnerabilities in the codebase.
  
- **Frequency:**
  - Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and address identified issues promptly.

## Incident Response

### 1. Incident Handling

- **Procedure:**
  - Establish a clear incident response plan outlining steps to take in case of a security breach.
  - Assign roles and responsibilities for responding to incidents.

### 2. Communication

- **Internal Communication:**
  - Ensure timely communication among team members during an incident.
  
- **External Communication:**
  - Notify affected users and relevant authorities as required by regulations in case of data breaches.

### 3. Post-Incident Analysis

- **Review:**
  - Conduct a thorough analysis of the incident to identify root causes.
  
- **Improvement:**
  - Implement measures to prevent similar incidents in the future based on findings.

## Compliance

### 1. Data Protection Laws

- **GDPR:**  
  - Ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation for handling user data.
  
- **CCPA:**  
  - Comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act for users in California.

### 2. Financial Regulations

- **Licensing:**  
  - Verify that all trading activities comply with relevant financial licensing requirements.
  
- **Reporting:**  
  - Maintain accurate records for auditing and regulatory reporting purposes.

## Conclusion

Security is integral to the integrity and trustworthiness of the **Automated Multi-Broker Trading System**. By adhering to the measures outlined in this document, we ensure the protection of user data, maintain system integrity, and comply with regulatory standards. Continuous evaluation and improvement of security practices are essential to adapt to evolving threats and maintain a secure trading environment.
