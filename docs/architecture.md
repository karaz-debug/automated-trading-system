# System Architecture

## Overview

The **Automated Multi-Broker Trading System** is designed to execute trading strategies across multiple brokers and exchanges seamlessly. The system is modular, scalable, and secure, ensuring efficient trade executions and comprehensive data management.

## High-Level Architecture

*Note: Replace this placeholder with an actual architecture diagram.*

## Components

### 1. Data Layer

- **Data Feeds:** Real-time market data from multiple brokers and exchanges via APIs.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for storing trade histories, user data, and market data.

### 2. Processing Layer

- **Trading Strategies:** Implemented using Backtrader, generating trade signals based on live data.
- **Execution Engine:** Processes trade signals and executes orders through connected brokers/exchanges.

### 3. Interface Layer

- **Backend APIs:** Built with FastAPI, handling data requests, user management, and interactions between frontend and backend.
- **Frontend Dashboard:** Developed with React.js, providing users with monitoring and management capabilities.

### 4. Infrastructure Layer

- **Deployment:** Hosted on AWS using services like EC2, S3, and CloudFront.
- **DevOps:** CI/CD pipelines managed with GitHub Actions, ensuring automated testing and deployment.
- **Security:** Implemented via JWT authentication, HTTPS, and secure environment configurations.

## Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition:** Live data is fetched from brokers/exchanges and streamed into Backtrader.
2. **Signal Generation:** Backtrader processes data through trading strategies to generate buy/sell signals.
3. **Trade Execution:** The Execution Engine consumes signals and executes trades via broker APIs.
4. **Data Storage:** Executed trades and related data are stored in PostgreSQL.
5. **User Interaction:** Users monitor and manage trading activities through the React.js dashboard.
6. **Deployment & Monitoring:** The system is deployed on AWS with continuous monitoring and automated scaling.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript
- **Backend Framework:** FastAPI
- **Trading Framework:** Backtrader
- **Frontend Framework:** React.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Task Queue:** Celery with Redis
- **APIs & Libraries:** CCXT, Alpaca Trade API, Web3.py
- **Deployment:** AWS EC2, S3, CloudFront, Nginx
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Security:** JWT, SSL/TLS

## Scalability and Extensibility

The system is designed to easily integrate additional brokers and exchanges by adding new modules in the `execution_engine` component. Modular design principles ensure that each component can be scaled independently based on demand.

## Security Measures

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Implemented using JWT tokens.
- **Data Encryption:** All data in transit is encrypted using HTTPS. Sensitive data at rest is encrypted in the database.
- **API Rate Limiting:** Protects against abuse and ensures compliance with broker/exchange API limits.
- **Regular Audits:** Security audits are conducted to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
